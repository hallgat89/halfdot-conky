# halfdot-conky
A black conky bar to create a halftone dot transition between the panel and wallpaper

I wanted to create some kind of gradient transition between the wallpaper and i3status bar,
but shadows and ordinary gradients don't suit my taste. I wanted to replicate those black dots on car windows.

I think it is mostly ideal for nature wallpapers. The attached config is for i3wm.
If your bar has a different color, you will have to recolor the image.
Also if your screen is wider than 1920px, you will need to extend the image.
